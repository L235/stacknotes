- "it has been the great privilege of my timew on Wikipedia to serve the community as a member of the 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Arbitration Committees"
- general reflections
	- unsustainable, it's a wonder it works at all. 
		- the #1 trait of a good arb is to be around
	- still have a *lot* to do on process improvements; and individuals can have more impact than they'd think
	- future of Wikipedia, troubling
	- ArbCom fills roles where nobody else can
	- ...
- advice for candidates
	- ...
	- we tend to elect unobjectionable broadly-popular admins, but e.g. AE experience is actually very good [and something I will consider jumping in on in a bit]
- reflections
	- very active 2021-22, less active 2023, should definitely have stepped down in 2022 or latest 2023
	- I was more of an "improvements" and "projects" arb than pretty much anyone else I think
	- I actually spent less time on cases than I probably should

for talk
- taking some time away

It has been the great privilege of my time as a Wikipedia editor to serve as a member of the 2021â€“2024 Arbitration Committees. I think Wikipedia is one of the best things that humanity has created, and it has brought me a great deal of joy to serve the Wikipedia community as an arb.

The community only rarely gets a glimpse into the committee's internal workings and even more rarely gets any individual insight into the performance of the arbitrators it is responsible for electing, so I wanted to publish an "exit memo" of sorts that offers some thoughts on ArbCom as well as a self-assessment of my four years as as a member, and before that six years as a clerk, for the benefit of future candidates as well as the community at large.<ref>I've been particularly inspired by the writings of [[User:Barkeep49/So you're thinking about running for ArbCom|Barkeep49]], [[User:Worm That Turned/Rant On/Being an arbitrator|Worm That Turned]], [[User:Maxim/Thoughts on arbitration|Maxim]], and others at [[:Category:User_essays_on_arbitration]]. It would be quite beneficial for every ArbCom candidate to read those.</ref>

== Self-assessment ==
; What I'm proud of.
* For my first couple years on ArbCom, I was one of the committee's workhorses. I spent a considerable amount of time investigating and resolving appeals, ...
* Throughout my time on ArbCom, I ended up leading on a large number of long-term projects. I think compared with other arbs, I was much more willing to take long-term leadership on ongoing projects{{snd}}the kind that last longer than a single arbitration case{{snd}}such as [CTOP, ]
* I think the ''way'' in which I contributed was often conducive to making progress. Especially toward the end of my time on ArbCom (which included some of the committee's most difficult private work during my time on the committee), I think I was able to help move major, time-sensitive decisions forward by drafting decisions and workshopping them to find consensus, rather than just entering votes... [I tend to think that ...]
* Technical infrastructure [communications]
* WMF relationships

; What I'm less proud of.
* Activity: This is the big one. The #1 job of an arbitrator is to show up and put in the work. Over the years, I grew much busier in real life. I have since concluded that I should not have run for reelection in 2022, and ''certainly'' should have resigned my seat in time for it to be filled by a newly elected arbitrator. {{pb}} I think it's hard from outside to get a good sense for how active arbs are on the off-wiki work (which is the bulk of the committee's work), but one imperfect proxy is the number of emails one sends to the committee's main mailing list, ''arbcom-en'':<ref>This count does not include the emails each arbitrator sent on behalf of the full committee from the ''arbcom-en'' address directly. It also does not count emails sent to ''arbcom-en-b'' and ''arbcom-en-c'' (secondary mailing lists for specific purposes), to ''clerks-l'' or ''functionaries-en'', or edits and communications on the Committee's private wiki, all of which are used for off-wiki ArbCom work. That said, it's a decent proxy because most off-wiki ArbCom work involves ''arbcom-en''.</ref>
** In 2021, there were 9,687 total emails (including from non-arbitrators), of which I sent 721 emails (7.4%, 5th among arbitrators).
** In 2022, there were 7,679 total emails, of which I sent 724 (9.4%, 2nd among arbs).
** In 2023, there were 7,826 total emails, of which I sent 360 (4.6%, 8th among arbs).
** In 2024, there were 6,435 total emails, of which I sent 206 (3.2%, 12th among arbs).
* Stalling workstreams. 
* Contentious topis/discretionary sanctions. I'm very glad we moved the CTOP reform. But hindsight has left me with doubts that we were as ambitious as we should have been, or, alternatively, that it was worth the effort we put into DS2021 to achieve fairly minor reforms that did not accomplish the important goal of simplifying and 
** I also misread the problem (clerks, templates, etc.)

'''As a clerk.'''

'''What's next for me.'''

These will be in no particular order:

'''Who we need on ArbCom.''' 

'''On the nature of ArbCom.''' 

'''Workload.''' 

'''Workflow management.'''

'''Looking forward to the year ahead.''' 2025 ArbCom will be good

other points
- for userpage: `The clearest sign for me that I needed a break after these ten years came, interestingly enough, ''after'' I left the Committee. For years, I would wake up in the morning and, by sheer muscle memory, open and skim my Wikipedia email on my phone, then IRC and the feed of all edits to arbitration-related pages, and then Discord, answering anything especially urgent and marinating on the rest (alongside my ''actual'' job). Throughout the day, I would periodically check and re-check the various feeds. I felt myself living in a constant state of distraction `
- `honestly, I also feel quite troubled about Wikipedia's future. This is a critical time, and in the coming years the community will need to navigate challenges like the rise of AI, fall in readership of traditional (written) media, and declining editor base and community vibrancy. Because of its decentralization, Wikipedia is perhaps not nimble enough to actually evolve the way we serve our free-knowledge mission (our core product, policies, and structures are essentially the same as they were in 2008), but I think it is critical to consider those questions now. I think that's where you all come in: I know it might feel like an odd fit, but there's nobody better than ArbCom to start to seriously tackle these questions. This group has the necessary combination of community trust and legitimacy, WMF relationship, diversity of background, and positioning to actually have a vision of the future to be able to take this on. It's possible that this is all a lost cause, that maybe Wikipedia really should go quietly into the night, but I'll be damned if I don't think that we've got something special going here and we should do everything we can to -- in Maryana Pinchuk's words -- make Wikimedia a multigenerational project.[2][3]`
- Wikipedia is remarkably special not only for its scale (which is itself impressive) but for its remarkable [eschewing of the profit-driven incentives that fuels essentially every other collaboration of this scale] and unique resistance to external control (advertisers, takeovers, etc.).
