- there's been this narrative lately that "bespoke sanctions" at ArbCom are more trouble than they're worth
- I think this is too great a generalization
- _topic_-level bespoke sanctions are actually quite good
	- pitfalls: if they become a permanent solution to a temporary solution, or a band-aid that covers up some substantive thing
- bespoke personal sanctions are also pretty good  often
	- they are certainly costly on enforcement (people have to police it, and there are questions about what's in and what's out)
	- but, 
	- and, it's not like we do a good job of administering sanctions currently. We should allow uninvolved admins to make clarifications and minor adjustments to sanctions
